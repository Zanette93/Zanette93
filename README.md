# Hi there, I'm JoÃ£o (John)! ðŸ‘‹
## Welcome to my profile

I am Brazilian with a degree in Food Engineering and also with a postgraduate degree in People Management. After 5 years of working in Food Industries as a Production Supervisor I decided to face the challenge of entering the technology field! I'm at the beginning of my studies and I want to make my dream come true by working in this area, being a collaborative user as soon as I acquire a little more knowledge. I'm open to work and learning opportunities!
My focus will be on Data Analysis.
